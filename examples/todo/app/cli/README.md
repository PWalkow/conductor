To-do Cli App
=============

This application allows you to access the 'mybuilder/todo-package' title listing
service from the CLI.
Tasks are persisted using a file-based JSON representation, and the application
prefills this store with dummy data so as to provide the example with meaning.

Demo
----

To run the example, the following commands must be executed from within this
directory:

``` bash
$ composer install
$ ./todo
* Task 1
* Task 2
* Task 3
```
